									<h2><b>My Contributions</b></h2>
									<p>I was a part of a 5-person development team. We were provided with 15 trivia questions to incorporate into the game. I used 3 of the trivia questions and developed 3 mini-games to go with them. I also created the thumbnail for our video presentation seen above. As a team we worked together on the UI design for each trivia question and menus. </p>

									<h2>Mini-Game #1: Buddy Maker</h2>
									<p>This mini-game is centered around Stephen the Seagull. Help Stephen collect plastic bottles from the beach and take them to the factory to be shredded. After being shredded take the pieces to another factory to make a recyclable stuffed animal.</p>

									<p>This mini-game is also centered around Stephen the Seagull. Help Stephen collect balloons floating over the ocean before they fall in. Missing too many balloons will result in game over.</p>
